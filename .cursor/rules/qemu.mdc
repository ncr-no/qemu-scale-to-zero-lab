Understand the scaling logic:
- N is variable; all blocks for QEMU services and routes must be rendered via loops.

For docker-compose.j2:
- Define base services: caddy, sablier
- Loop to generate qemu_i services (with environment, volumes, labels, etc.)
- Set shared network

For Caddyfile.j2:
- Add sablier-before-reverse_proxy directive
- Add default homepage response and redirect rules
- Loop to create route /qemu_i/* with sablier and reverse proxy blocks

Ensure correctness:
- Jinja2 control structures ({% for ... %}, etc.)
- No hardcoded numbers except where required
- Template readable, organized

Output Format:
- Clearly separate both templates with comments or filenames
- No extra narrative or markdown formatting â€” raw Jinja2 output
